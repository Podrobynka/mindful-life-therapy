This can be done in person or over the phone. There is no obligation to commit at this point but if it feels good to pursue a working relationship we would usually start by contracting for six sessions. This is a standard starting point and may be extended if longer term therapy is needed.<br><br>Mindful Life Therapy is based in peaceful and comfortable premises in <strong>Newton Place</strong>; close to Charing Cross railway station.<br><br></div><div>The address is: <strong>10 Newton Place, Glasgow, G3 7PR.</strong><br><br></div><h2>Memberships and Qualifications</h2><div><br></div><div>Zoe's list of memberships and qualifications includes the following:<br><br></div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bacp.co.uk/profile/239578cc-4f90-e711-80e8-3863bb349ac0/Therapist\">Registered Member</a> of the <strong>&nbsp;British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)</strong></li><li><strong>Post Graduate Diploma in Counselling</strong> from the University of Strathclyde</li><li><strong>Compassion Focused Therapy</strong> Levels 1 &amp; 2</li><li><strong>COSCA Certificate in Counselling Skills</strong> from Glasgow Caledonian University</li><li><strong>Mindfulness Teacher Training</strong> at Bangor University</li><li><strong>Mindfulness Practitioner Training</strong> with the Mindfulness Association</li><li><strong>Mindful Self Compassion Core Skills Training</strong> with Drs Chris Germer and Kristin Neff</li></ul><div><br></div><h2>On Mindfulness</h2><div><br></div><div>Zoe incorporates Mindfulness into her therapeutic work and also offers regular opportunities for groups, or individuals, to train on the world famous <strong>Eight Week Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)</strong> course, as well as day courses, workshops and retreats in <strong>Mindfulness,</strong> <strong>Mindful Compassion</strong> and <strong>Self Compassion.<br></strong><br></div><h2>About Zoe Zalavary</h2><div><br></div><div>Zoe is an experienced meditator who has practised Buddhist meditation for over seventeen years. In 2000, she left her job at the BBC in Leeds (after initially training in Broadcast Journalism) and moved into a residential Buddhist college in Yorkshire, to train in Buddhist philosophy, psychology and meditation.</div><div><br>The initial sabbatical she planned ended up becoming ten years of living in community, nine of which she was ordained as a Buddhist nun. During this time she taught many meditation classes and courses.<br><br></div><div>In 2009, Zoe accomplished a long held dream of completing a three year solitary meditation retreat in the forest of Ae in Dumfriesshire. Her time in retreat was deeply transformational; she experienced some of the highest highs and lowest lows, increasing her insight and self awareness.<br><br></div><div>After finishing her retreat she was drawn to the city to bring her experience of working with the mind to benefit people in the heart of the community. Intending to bring her experience of Buddhist Psychology and meditation into a Western secular context, she has since been further developing her skills by training in Person-Centred Therapy (at the University of Strathclyde) and Compassion Focused Therapy with Prof Paul Gilbert and Dr Chris Irons.<br><br></div><div>Although Zoe had already practised Mindfulness for many years through her Buddhist training, she decided to train as a secular Mindfulness teacher with Bangor University so she would be able to offer Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (Bangor is one of only three higher educational establishments in the UK that offer teacher training in MBSR and MBCT).<br><br></div><div>Zoe also trained in Compassion Based Mindfulness approaches through the Mindfulness Association, with Prof Paul Gilbert and Choden in their model of Mindful Compassion and with Dr Chris Germer and Dr Kristin Neff in their model of Mindful Self Compassion.</div>"
